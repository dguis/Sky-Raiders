      <strong class='sect'>Cole</strong><br>
Cole, a 6th grader from Arizona, is the main character of the book. He is brave, loyal, hopeful and smart. When faced with peril, he says things like “Fun to think about!”. When times seem terrible, and chances of saving his friends, Dalton and Jenna seem terrible, he still pushes forward and keeps op hope of saving them. He is strong in being brave, and weak in choosing between who to save.
<br><strong class="sect">Mira (Miracle)</strong><br>
Mira is an experienced, optimistic old princess. Even though her father stole some of her remarkable power, making her never seem any older, she still finds something happy to think about. Whatever the situation she always knows what to do to have the best outcome.
<br><strong class="sect">Jace</strong><br>
Jace is a brave, stubborn young hero. He won’t agree to anything anyone says. Not even the princess, Mira. For instance, when a slave treated him badly, he dumped soup on the slave’s head. However, when Mira chastises him for his rudeness, he ignores her and argues: "…I can survive just fine on my own.". Although he can be rude, when it is important, he is always quick to rush to the rescue.
<br><strong class="sect">Twitch</strong><br>
Twitch is a young boy whose original form is a flying bug. He is cautious and loyal. When in danger, his first instinct is to run away. Despite his timidness, he is very loyal to anyone who treats him kindly.
<br><strong class="sect">Liam</strong><br>
Liam is a mischievous and creative shaper, and a servant of Declan. When having to conquer a dangerous enemy, he laughs at it and creates something out of thin air to defeat it. He creates and transforms many funny things including a giant pig made of carpet, a room made of edible furniture, a room with furniture balancing on one leg, flying robot bugs, a talking happy face and transforming poison into honey.
<br><strong class="sect">Declan</strong><br>
Declan is a wise old shaper. He was very helpful to Cole and Mira in discussing what they should do about overthrowing the king. Him and his servants conjured gifts to help Cole and his friends on their journey.
<br><strong class="sect">Dalton</strong><br>
Dalton is a young 6th grade boy with a sense of humor. Although he was kidnapped, he still continued to smile and make jokes. Despite his sense of humor, he is also very aware of his surroundings. For example, he noticed a door locking and odd things about a haunted house that turned out to be a kidnapper’s trap.
<br><strong class="sect">Jenna</strong><br>
Jenna is a kind, young, and hopeful girl. She followed along with Cole as long as she could, even though things seemed scary. She was nice to her kidnappers despite their crimes, and when Cole promised to rescue her, she never gave up hope.
