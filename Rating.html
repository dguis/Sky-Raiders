  <p>On a scale from 1-10, I would rate this book an eight. I would rate it like this because it was a great book, with lots of action and exciting events that left me longing to read more. Although there were a few better books in which the storyline was a little more exciting and interesting overall, this book was pretty high on a scale of books I have read.</p>
